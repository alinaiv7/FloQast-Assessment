// Run the tests:
npm test

UI and API servers start automatically when the tests run. API runs on port 3001, UI runs on port 3000.
// Run this command if you want to start both servers manually
npm run dev

Mock UI url: http://localhost:3000/test-ui.html


// Helpers, custom assertions, and data factories are located in utils.js
